This is for students.
To get the pygame module, I'd reccomend pip. Pip is a software package, and 
usually it comes with Python. You might need to install it. Put it in root.
I'd strongly suggest researching how to do this yourself.

This tutorial will be oriented towards making a functional game. Pygame
is a good tool, however extremely basic and lower-level than something like
GameMaker, although GM is a powerful tool in and of itself. If you are to make
a game, I'd suggest setting your sites fairly low and making a basic game.
